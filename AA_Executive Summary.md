# **Examining the Impact of Pell Grant Distribution on Graduation Rates: A Comparative Study of HBCUs and Non-HBCUs**

#### *Understanding how institutional characteristics influence the graduation outcomes of Pell Grant recipients in U.S. higher education.*

## **Introduction**
This research examines the role of Pell Grant distribution in shaping graduation outcomes within U.S. higher education, particularly focusing on disparities between Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other institutional types. Pell Grants serve as the primary federal aid mechanism for low-income students, yet significant questions remain regarding how institutional characteristics—such as control (public, private nonprofit), academic level (2-year, 4-year), and HBCU designation—influence the graduation rates of recipients.

## **Purpose**
The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the proportion of Pell Grant recipients at U.S. postsecondary institutions and their graduation rates within 150% of normal program time. The research further examines how this relationship varies based on institutional characteristics, particularly between 2-year and 4-year colleges, and between public and private nonprofit institutions. A key objective is to assess whether Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) exhibit distinct graduation outcomes for Pell Grant recipients when compared to non-HBCU institutions. By focusing on these comparative dimensions, the study aims to provide empirical insights into the structural factors influencing degree completion among low-income students.

## **Methodology**
This study used data from a national dataset to explore how different types of institutions influence the graduation rates of Pell Grant recipients. The data included graduation rates for students receiving Pell Grants at various colleges and universities across the U.S. To ensure the analysis was accurate, the data was cleaned and processed, including converting percentage values into a format suitable for analysis and removing incomplete records. The final dataset included over 100,000 data points from 5,736 institutions. The analysis involved summarizing the data using simple statistical methods and visual charts to identify patterns. Additionally, advanced statistical models were applied to examine how factors like the type of institution (2-year vs. 4-year, public vs. private) and whether an institution is an HBCU influenced the graduation outcomes of Pell Grant recipients.

## **Analysis**
The findings highlight significant disparities in graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients across different institutional types. HBCU status was negatively associated with graduation rates, with HBCUs showing lower success rates compared to non-HBCUs (β = -0.147, p < 0.001), as visualized by box plots that revealed greater variability and generally lower outcomes for HBCU students. The type of institution also mattered; private nonprofit institutions had higher graduation rates than public ones (β = 0.118, p < 0.001), as shown in bar plots. This suggests that private institutions may offer better resources and support for Pell recipients. Additionally, 4-year institutions outperformed 2-year colleges by 5.9 percentage points in graduation rates (β = 0.059, p < 0.001), with bar plots clearly indicating higher success at 4-year institutions. These findings underscore how institutional characteristics, such as control, level, and HBCU status, significantly influence Pell Grant recipient graduation outcomes.

## **Recommendations**

In light of the disparities uncovered in the analysis, several key recommendations emerge. First, there is a pressing need for increased federal and state investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to address the chronic underfunding that limits their ability to support Pell Grant recipients effectively. Strengthening these institutions can help close the graduation gap between HBCUs and other types of institutions. Additionally, policy reforms should focus on enhancing support systems for Pell recipients at 2-year and public institutions, ensuring that they have the resources and infrastructure to succeed. Finally, improving transparency and accountability in the reporting of Pell-specific graduation outcomes is crucial. This will allow policymakers, educators, and the public to better track equity goals and make informed decisions about how to improve educational opportunities for low-income students across all types of institutions.

## **Implementation**
To effectively implement the recommended changes, several key components must be considered. First, substantial resources are required, particularly in the form of direct funding to under-resourced institutions, with a focus on providing academic support, advising, and improving campus infrastructure, especially at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In terms of a timeframe, policy shifts and new funding models should be phased in over a 3–5 year period, allowing institutions the necessary time to build the required capacity and make the necessary adjustments. Oversight will also be essential—federal and state agencies must closely monitor progress, using disaggregated metrics based on race, income, and institution type to assess the impact of these initiatives. Finally, risk mitigation strategies should be adopted, including performance-based funding formulas that do not penalize institutions serving high-risk populations but instead support them in their efforts to improve student outcomes.

## **Conclusion**
This study underscores the persistent inequalities within the U.S. higher education system, particularly in how Pell Grant distribution interacts with institutional characteristics to influence graduation rates. While Pell Grants serve as a crucial lifeline for low-income students, their effectiveness is significantly shaped by the type of institution attended. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), despite their critical role in supporting disadvantaged students, face systemic challenges that contribute to lower graduation rates for Pell recipients compared to their counterparts at non-HBCU institutions. Additionally, the analysis revealed that private nonprofit institutions and 4-year colleges generally provide more favorable conditions for Pell Grant recipients, highlighting the impact of institutional resources and support systems.

The findings stress the need for targeted policy interventions aimed at addressing these disparities. Increased funding for HBCUs and enhanced support systems for Pell recipients at public and 2-year institutions are essential steps toward leveling the playing field. Moreover, greater transparency in graduation reporting will help track progress and ensure that equity goals are met. Ultimately, addressing these structural inequities through thoughtful investment and policy reforms will not only improve graduation rates but also promote greater socioeconomic mobility for low-income students, particularly those attending HBCUs. This study calls for a comprehensive, long-term commitment to reform that can drive positive change across U.S. higher education and ensure that Pell Grants fulfill their potential as a tool for broadening access to higher education.
